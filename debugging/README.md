# Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency with ChatGPT

Welcome to a specialized module of our IT curriculum where we explore innovative ways to integrate artificial intelligence into everyday coding practices.

This project focuses on two pivotal aspects of software development: debugging and automation. By engaging with these tasks, youâ€™ll learn how to harness the capabilities of ChatGPT to not only identify and resolve errors more efficiently but also to automate repetitive coding tasks, thereby increasing your productivity and improving the quality of your code.

## Objectives

 * Debugging: Understand the practical use of AI in identifying and solving coding errors. You will use ChatGPT to diagnose and correct bugs in provided code samples across multiple programming languages. This will enhance your problem-solving skills and understanding of common programming pitfalls in a diverse set of coding environments.

 * Automation: Learn how to automate mundane and repetitive coding tasks with the assistance of ChatGPT. This involves generating boilerplate code, documentation, and even basic unit tests, freeing up time to focus on more complex and creative aspects of software development.

## Outcomes

 * Enhanced Debugging Skills: Gain confidence in troubleshooting and refining code, with an ability to articulate problems clearly and implement AI-driven solutions effectively.

 * Automation Proficiency: Develop skills to leverage AI for automating coding tasks, leading to more structured and error-free code.

## Tasks

0. Debugging - Python Factorial

    The code calculates the factorial of a number given as a command-line argument and prints the result. It seems correct for its intended purpose. However, to ensure it's fully functional, I'll outline a few key aspects:

     * Command-Line Argument Handling: The script expects an argument when run. If no argument is provided, it will raise an error. It's good practice to add error handling to check if the argument is provided and if it's a valid integer.

     * Non-Positive Integers: The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input is zero or negative. The factorial of zero should be 1, and factorials of negative numbers are not defined.

1. Debugging - Python Arguments

    In this version, range(1, len(sys.argv)) starts the loop from index 1 instead of index 0, effectively skipping the script's filename (sys.argv[0]) and only printing the arguments passed to the script.

2. Debugging - HTML / Javascript

    Changing the background color of the page each time the button is clicked.

3. Debugging - Python Mines

    This should correctly handle the gameplay logic, including determining when a player has won the game by revealing all non-mine cells.

4. Documentation - Python Factorial

    A brief summary of what the factorial function does, explaining the concept of factorial and the method used (recursion).

5. Error Handling - Python Checkbook

    Mini program Checkbook for track the money. 

6. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python

    Fix erros and play the game Tic Tac Toe successfully.
